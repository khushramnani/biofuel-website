                <p>

                    Animal feed refers to a specially formulated food product that is specifically designed to provide
                    balanced nutrition and meet the dietary requirements of various animals. It is used to supplement or
                    replace the natural diet of animals, ensuring that they receive the necessary nutrients for growth,
                    development, reproduction, and overall health.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our Products has enormous potential as a livestock animal feed due to:

                    Its high content in proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin B12, Beta
                    Carotene), growth promoter intermediaries and minerals.
                    Its ability to proliferate without inorganic nitrogen fertilization.
                    Its high rate of growth in water without the need to displace existing crops or natural ecological
                    systems.

                    Although the demand for milk and meat has increased in the country ,there has also been a substantial decline in fodder production owing to the decreasing forest and grassland areas.  Shortages of fodder are therefore, resulting in increased cost of meat and milk production. Moreover, as usage of artificial milk boosters, it has a deleterious effect on the quality of milk produced and the longevity of the livestock, which in turn leads to degenerative diseases like cancer and coronary ailments in human beings.

                    Using our product, the  increase in the milk yield was to the tune of 10–15%, which went up to 20%. It is found that the increase in the quantity of the milk produced on the base of nutrients was highest.  Hence, it is assumed that more than the carbohydrate, protein content and other components, like carotenoids, biopolymers, probiotics etc., may be contributing to the overall increase in the production of milk.``
                    
                    When use of our products it will  improve the quality of milk , health and longevity of livestock.

                    The poultry industry has traditionally been one of the most important businesses , providing
                    nutritious meats and eggs for human consumption within the shortest possible time.

                    However, the industry is now threatened by higher prices and the non-availability of feed
                    ingredients, reflecting feed costs comprising 60-65% of the total cost of poultry production.

                    In India, our Products could replace most of the commercial feed in the diet of young chickens.The
                    number of eggs laid per bird and the quality of eggs (the yellow yolk portion of egg being more
                    prominent and yellowish) was better than in birds fed by other products.
                    Live weight, production number and protein efficiency were significantly improved.
                    Feed conversion ratio and energy efficiency were significantly improved.

                    The total cost significantly lower with our Products .

                    Dressing and giblet percentages was significantly increased on diet with our Products .

                    Our products have no deleterious effect on the palatability of diets.
